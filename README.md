# CloudScraper.js

A Node.js wrapper for Python-based CloudFlare bypass functionality. This library is a JavaScript port of the popular `cloudscraper` Python library, designed to help developers bypass CloudFlare protection mechanisms in their Node.js applications.

## üéØ Purpose

CloudScraper.js provides a seamless way to make HTTP requests to websites protected by CloudFlare, handling JavaScript challenges, CAPTCHAs, and other protection mechanisms automatically. It's particularly useful for:

- Web scraping applications
- API integrations with CloudFlare-protected endpoints
- Automated testing of protected websites
- Data collection from sites with anti-bot protection

## üöÄ Features

- **Automatic CloudFlare bypass**: Handles JavaScript challenges and CAPTCHAs
- **Multi-platform support**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Virtual environment support**: Automatic Python dependency management
- **Easy installation**: One-command setup with automatic dependency installation
- **TypeScript support**: Full type definitions included
- **Multiple HTTP methods**: GET, POST, COOKIE, and TOKENS support

## üì¶ Installation

This library requires both Python and Node.js. For detailed installation instructions, see [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md).

### Quick Start

```bash
npm install cloudscraper.js
```

The installation process will automatically:

- Check for Python installation
- Install Python if needed (macOS/Linux)
- Create virtual environment if required
- Install the `cloudscraper` Python library

## üîß Usage

```javascript
// ES6
import CloudScraper from "cloudscraper.js";

// CommonJS
const CloudScraper = require("cloudscraper.js").default;

const scraper = new CloudScraper({
  usePython3: true, // Set to true if using python3, false for python
  timeoutInSeconds: 10,
});

// Simple GET request
scraper
  .get("https://example.com")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log("Status:", response.status);
    console.log("Data:", response.text());
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });

// POST request with data
scraper
  .post("https://api.example.com", {
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ key: "value" }),
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.json());
  });
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Status

**‚ö†Ô∏è Early Development Phase**

This library is currently in early development. While functional, it may have limitations and breaking changes as we continue to improve it. We're actively working on:

- Enhanced error handling
- Better performance optimization
- Additional HTTP methods support
- Improved documentation
- More robust CloudFlare challenge handling

**We plan to release regular updates** to improve functionality and maintain compatibility with the latest CloudFlare protection mechanisms.
